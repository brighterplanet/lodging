## Lodging impact model
# This model is used by the [Brighter Planet](http://brighterplanet.com) [CM1 web service](http://carbon.brighterplanet.com) to calculate the impacts of a lodging (e.g. a hotel stay), such as energy use, greenhouse gas emissions, and water use.

##### Timeframe
# The model calculates impacts that occured during a particular time period (`timeframe`).
# For example if the `timeframe` is February 2010, a lodging that occurred (`date`) on February 15, 2010 will have impacts, but a lodging that occurred on January 31, 2010 will have zero impacts.
#
# The default `timeframe` is the current calendar year.

##### Calculations
# The final impacts are the result of the calculations below. These are performed in reverse order, starting with the last calculation listed and finishing with the greenhouse gas emissions calculation.
#
# Each calculation listing shows:
#
# * value returned (*units of measurement*)
# * description of the value
# * calculation methods, listed from most to least preferred
#
# Some methods use `values` returned by prior calculations. If any of these `values` are unknown the method is skipped.
# If all the methods for a calculation are skipped, the value the calculation would return is unknown.

##### Standard compliance
# When compliance with a particular standard is requested, all methods that do not comply with that standard are ignored.
# Thus any `values` a method needs will have been calculated using a compliant method or will be unknown.
# To see which standards a method complies with, look at the `:complies =>` section of the code in the right column.
#
# Client input complies with all standards.

##### Collaboration
# Contributions to this impact model are actively encouraged and warmly welcomed. This library includes a comprehensive test suite to ensure that your changes do not cause regressions. All changes should include test coverage for new functionality. Please see [sniff](https://github.com/brighterplanet/sniff#readme), our emitter testing framework, for more information.
